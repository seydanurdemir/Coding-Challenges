/**
 * AB Check
 * 
 * Have the function ABCheck(str) take the str parameter being passed 
 * and return the string true if the characters a and b are separated by 
 * exactly 3 places anywhere in the string at least once (ie. "lane borrowexd" 
 * would result in true because there is exactly three characters between a 
 * and b). Otherwise return the string false.
 * 
 * Examples
 * 
 * Input: "after badly"
 * Output: false
 * 
 * Input: "Laura sobs"
 * Output: true
